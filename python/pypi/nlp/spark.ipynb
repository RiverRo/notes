    "Available Features | Description\n",
    "--- | ---\n",
    "sentiment analysis |\n",
    "Financial NER models | Extracting organizations, products, revenue, profit, losses, trading symbols, SEC 10-K information,...\n",
    "text classification | classify texts into specific financial categories\n",
    "Entity linking| to normalize NER entities and link them to public databases/data sources, such as Edgar, Crunchbase, and Nasdaq. By doing that, you can augment Company Names, for example, with externally available data about them\n",
    "Pattern matching |Use context-aware symbolic components to model patterns to combine with Deep Learning information extraction techniques\n",
    "financial embeddings| The result is an n-dimensional embedding matrix, impossible to process by the human eye, containing the interpretation of the text using a financial domain\n",
    "assertion status | infer temporality (present, past, future), probability (possible), or other conditions in the context of the extracted entities\n",
    "relation extraction| infer relations between the extracted entities. For example, the relations of the parties in an agreement\n",
    "question answering | Financial Question Answering model, finetuned on proprietary Financial questions and answers\n",
    "Knowledge graphs | Create Knowledge bases combining entities and relations in a graph, which can be exploited afterward in graph databases\n",
    "Table understanding| Use State-of-the-Art Deep Learning architectures to query tables (extracted, for example, with Spark OCR) with Natural Language. No training is needed\n",
    "Zero-shot-learning | Spark NLP for Finance includes Zero-shot NER and Zero-shot Relation Extraction, to create your information extraction models without any training data, just with examples (prompts)\n",
    "Deidentification | The task of detecting privacy-related entities in text, such as person names, emails, and contact data"
