    "- Fine-tuning a model is a terminology used in transfer learning and means re-training a model on more specific datasets.  Transfer learning is the process of using a trained model in one context in another context.  This allows for rapid and accessible, highly functionL models without the need for supercomputers.  The original trained models can run for days and require lots of processing power that only big companies have accces to, so they use their resources to train models on very larget benchmark datasets, which can then be re-trained/fine-tuned on smaller niche datasets\n",
    "    e.g. Google BERT model fine-tuned on financial data to produce FinBERT models\n",
    "- Hypertuning parameters is about configuring hyperparameters of a model.  There are many functions that can automate this process to find the best parameter combinations of a model given the a type of dataset"
